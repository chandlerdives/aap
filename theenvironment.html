            <h1>What more can we do?</h1>
            <p> In recent years there has been a huge shift in how customers handle and recycle the waste their business generates. For some time polythene and single use plastics have been considered 'dirty products', however we strongly believe that polythene and cardboard in particular are hugely important materials in packaging and will continue to be around for many years to come. So it makes sense to consider how well these so called dirty products are <strong>handled and disposed of</strong>, that's where we can help, guide and deliver.</p>
            <p><strong>We actively encourage all our clients and customers to consider how they effectively handle the waste generated on a daily basis.</strong> Working with our recycling partners we can supply a range of waste handling equipment to help customers:</p>
                <li>save money on their weekly bin collections</li>
                <li>generate income from their waste stream by using compactors and balers</li>
                <li>save valuable work space & car parking by reducing the amount of bins required on site</li>
                <li>reduce their carbon footprint due to fewer bin collections</li>
            <p>We visit premises to complete surveys before offering a comprehensive quotation detail where savings can be made and how income can be generated. We can tailor packages to suit all business, including outright purchase, leasing or renting machines over 3 or 5 years. We believe working together we can make a small step towards becoming a cleaner, greener, happier place to live.
