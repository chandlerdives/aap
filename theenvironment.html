            <h1>How do we help?</h1>
            <p>At All About Packaging we care about our planet and the environmental impacts associated with single use plastics. We are committed to helping customers minimise the packaging they use and find solutions which fit their circumstances, budget and sustainable credentials.</p>
            <p>For instance, we can offer high strength alternative polythene blends that help to reduce packaging weight and consumed raw materials without compromising performance or quality. We also offer products made from recycled materials if suitable, an incentive backed by government to offset the Plastic Packaging Tax ( PPT ) and reduce the overall amount of plastic used.</p>
            <p>Despite the bad press single use plastic and polythene products receive, accurate research shows that plastic packaging is an efficient lightweight resource which saves packaging mass, energy and greenhouse gas emissions. Food items packed in plastic allow for longer shelf life and therefore reduce food waste. This makes plastic the best choice for some businesses and for the planet. <strong>Plus all our packaging is 100% recyclable.</strong> </p>
            <p>How we <strong>recycle and dispose</strong> of our packaging waste is the key to protecting our environment for the long term. AAP can guide you through the most efficient ways to handle your waste using the correct recycling streams, improving your green credentials and often saving you money at the same time.</p>

            <h1>What more can we do?</h1>
            <p>In recent years there has been a huge drive to encourage customers to better handle and recycle the waste their business generates. Polythene and single-use plastics are often deemed 'dirty products', however we strongly believe that these products, and cardboard in particular, are hugely important materials in packaging and will continue to be for many years to come.</p>
            <p>It makes sense to consider how well these highly resourceful products are handled and disposed of. Working with our recycling partners, we can supply a range of waste handling equipment to help:</p>
                <li>Save money on your weekly bin collections.</li>
                <li>Generate income from your waste by utilising compactors and balers.</li>
                <li>Save valuable work space and car parking by reducing the amount of bins required on site.</li>
                <li>Reduce your <strong>carbon footprint</strong> due to fewer vehicle movements for bin collections.</li>
            <p>At AAP we aim to better inform customers on the various green packaging products which are available and guide on ways to minimise the impact of the material that they use has on our Planet.</p>
