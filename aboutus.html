            <h1>Kevin Pitcher</h1>
            <p>Having gained extensive knowledge working in the packaging manufacturing industry for 20 years I decided it was time for a change and branched out on my own.  In 2018 AAP was born and I have never looked back!</p>
            <p>From my working experience I felt there was a gap in the market for a company to provide clients with an affordable 'One Stop Shop Solution' for all their packaging needs.  Over the last 20 years I have built up a vast knowledge of packaging solutions to suit a wide array of industry sectors and believe AAP have proven to be the perfect fit for many of our clients.  Furthermore, I wanted to develop a packaging waste and recycling service to help my clients promote environmental sustainability.   I firmly believe that if we all make small changes they can make a big difference.</p>
            <p>AAP's philosophy is to provide top customer service and help our clients find optimal and cost effective solutions for their packaging and recycling requirements.  We want to work and develop long term partnerships with you -  that's the bottom line!</p>
            <p>Outside of work I enjoy spending time with my family, travelling to new places and seeing new things.  I am a keen golfer currently playing off a handicap of 8 and enjoy all sports.  I like coffee in the mornings, white with one sugar and tea in the afternoon, white with no sugar. My ideal accompaniment for both of these would be a Jammie Dodger, but just the one, I need to watch the waist line!</p>

            <h1>Lee Divers</h1>
            <p>1999, the year my packaging journey began! When I started working in the industry all those years ago I had no idea that one day I would be a partner in my own packaging business but here we are!</p>
            <p>Those early years helped me understand the importance of really listening to customers and understanding their problems and needs. I've been fortunate to learn my trade by working alongside some great people within the industry and early on I recall one of them telling me to  'look after the customer and the customer will look after you'. I've always remembered those pearls of wisdom and strived to ensure my clients get the best customer service I can offer. After all without customers there is no business!</p>
            <p>Let's face it packaging isn't sexy, but it does play an important role for many of our customers and I'm thankful they work with us and trust the products and service we provide, their loyalty is never taken for granted.</p>
            <p>When not working I'm with my family, most weekends are spent ferrying kids to various sporting events, and I enjoy catching up with friends when time allows. Unfortunately I can't compete with Kevin on the golf course but do enjoy an occasional round when the sun's out. You may even bump into me one evening at a gig, if you do then come and say hello but please only in between tracks... I hate it when people talk during a song! And lastly, if were talking biscuits with tea then there is only one winnerâ€¦..the dark chocolate digestive (not milk chocolate)!</p>

                <p>Lee at AAP has been a long term supplier for all our polythene liners. The product is always delivered in good time and if I've ever had any issues he helps out as quickly and gets it sorted. I get approached by lots of other suppliers but see no reason to change due to the quality of service and products he offers.</p>
