                <p>Lee at AAP has been a long term supplier for all our polythene liners. The product is always delivered in good time and if I've ever had any issues he helps out as quickly and gets it sorted. I get approached by lots of other suppliers but see no reason to change due to the quality of service and products he offers.</p>

                <p>Beechwood Events have been using AAP for quite a number of happy years. Their expertise of product suitability encouraged us to change from our old supplier - saving money without compromise of quality.</p>
